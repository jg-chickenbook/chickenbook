# üê§ Chickenbook

My goal is to create an app where members of Junior Guru[^1] can log in and create a simple developer profile they can show to the world. Anybody will be able to browse the profiles. There will be filters to view them according to a specific field, programming language and so on. Theoretically, companies might use such a database when looking for junior developers, as well as people looking for collaborators for their projects.

**Why Chickenbook?** Junior Guru has a chicken, more precisely a chick, in its logo, and there is also a chick/chicken bot on the community's Discord server. Chick would be more precise, but I thought Chickbook might be misleading üòÖ, so I decided on Chickenbook instead.
